## Abstract

The automated processing of multiple seismic signals to detect and
localize seismic events is a central tool in both geophysics and nuclear
treaty verification.  This paper reports on a project begun in 2009 to
reformulate this problem in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian seismic
monitoring system, NET-VISA, has been built comprising a spatial event
prior and generative models of event transmission and detection, as well
as an inference algorithm. The probabilistic model allows for seamless
integration of various disparate sources of information. Applied in the
context of the International Monitoring System (IMS), a global sensor
network developed for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT),
NET-VISA achieves a reduction of around 60% in the number of missed
events compared with the currently deployed system. It also finds events
that are missed by the human analysts who postprocess the IMS output.
