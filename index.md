## Bayesian Logic, Inc.

Our mission is to build Bayesian models for complex physical domains.

## NET-VISA

NET-VISA (NETwork processing Vertically Integrated Seismic Analysis) is a generative model for the creation of seismic events (natural or man-made) the propagation of seismic energy in multiple phases through the earth, and the detection (or mis-detection) of these phases at seismic stations plus the detection of noise.
