title: NET-VISA
---

NET-VISA (NETwork processing Vertically Integrated Seismic Analysis) is
a generative model for the creation of seismic events (natural or
man-made) the propagation of seismic energy in multiple phases through
the earth, and the detection (or mis-detection) of these phases at
seismic stations plus the detection of noise. The model also includes
infrasound and hydro-acoustic propagation.

This project has been deployed by the CTBT organization of the U.N. to
aid human analysts to locate nuclear explosions. It is under evaluation
for full deployment to produce automatic bulletins for distribution to
all states that have signed the treaty.
